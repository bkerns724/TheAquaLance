New Mechanics
    Resonant, formerly Wave
	All 1 cost.  Resonant cards merge together to form a more power card.
	    All resonant cards played in one turn become a single power.
	    This power puts a resonant 1 cost 3 damage attack card in your hand with all bonuses from resonant cards played last time
	    All resonant cards give a damage bonus equal to their damage - 4.
    Sigils
	Cards that can't be played normally, but have a special effect on discard.
    Lore tooltips
	No gameplay effect, but will have to code something up
