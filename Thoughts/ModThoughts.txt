Design
    Really need to think about shards and faster scaling.
    Flow is a little too good
    Replace anti-magic shard
    Make sure shard reactions are add to top
    Buff flak
    Buff roll
    Check damage on attacking with shard respecting buffs.
    Brr zerk to rare
    Feint wear off timing
    What to do with duplicate potion and shards?

Major Todo
    Get card backgrounds to Alison Moons
    Fix char select picture
    Get non Silent character skelly
    Card art?

The heart kill cg is way too long

I found that there seemed to be a lack of magic cards but plenty of intelligence on my run.
    Adding a little more payoff


ALCHYR
Lack of defense early.  Starting deck is a problem.
    Going to 4 defends, buff starting relic.  Starting deck thicker though.
    I am sure the block commons are good.
There aren't too many "pick this card up early on to deal with enemies" options.
    Buffed attack common damage a little
There are a lot of synergy and minor debuff cards in the common pool
    Need to keep an eye on synergy, debuffs are fine
