You only see one thing that interests you amongst the stalls, a weaponsmith who is selling a set of oils to enchant weapons with magic effects.  You can sense that their magic is genuine.  On your way over, an alchemist sees a potion on your belt and offers you a good price for it.",
      "You decide having a better fallback option for when you can't cast spells is a good investment.  You pay the price for the oil, and immediately rub some on your staff.  You prod the ground with your staff and it makes more of a dent than you expected.  Pleased, you carry on your way.",
      "You decide that gold is always useful.  You sell one of your less useful potions to an alchemist and receive a bag of gold in return.  You're not convinced the potion was worth as much as he was offering, but that's not your problem.  You carry on your way.",
      "You see nothing that interests you here.  You carry on your way."
