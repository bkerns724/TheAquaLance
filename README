A character mod for Slay the Spire.  Adds a spellcasting character, The Exile.
Her gameplay is focused on using elemental damage types, exploiting debuffs, sigils that can only be played via discard, 
and resonant spells that merge together to become one stronger spell.
Character is in progress, much of the art is placeholder.
Bug fixing and balance is close to completion but needs more iteration.
