I found that there seemed to be a lack of magic cards but plenty of intelligence on my run.
    Adding a little more payoff

Lack of defense early.  Starting deck is a problem.
    Going to 4 defends, buff starting relic.  Starting deck thicker though.
    I am sure the block commons are good.
There aren't too many "pick this card up early on to deal with enemies" options.
    Buffed attack common damage a little
There are a lot of synergy and minor debuff cards in the common pool
    Need to keep an eye on synergy, debuffs are fine
